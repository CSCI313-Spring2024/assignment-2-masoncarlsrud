              My career aspiration is unknown at the moment as I don't really have a clear idea as to what I want to do quite yet.

        <h2>Weekly Schedule</h2>
       <p>Throughout the week i dont have much going on, but I try to go to the gym in the evenings after work. I also use Tuesdays and Thursdays to do chores and around the house work. This schedule works for me because I have certain days to work and others to do homework and that allows me to be able to focus more and be more productive.</p>
